## 1. Allow some time to get the design as exact as you want it to be.

Once your beautiful new kitchen is installed you will enjoy it for many years to come. So it makes sense to invest as much time as necessary to make sure every detail of the final design is perfect.

From the colours, finishes and choosing the wood or paint finish you want to have, to working out where electrical sockets and lights need to be, the time to choose what you want and need is right at the start.

It sounds obvious to say that more time spent on decisions now will add years to your enjoyment of your truly bespoke kitchen, but it is true.

## 2. Collect a scrap book of cuttings from magazines to create your own wish list prior meeting a kitchen supplier.

To focus your ideas about how your kitchen should look you will find it very helpful to begin collecting photos, or images from the internet and pictures from magazines that appeal to you.

At the beginning, if you are simply not sure of the style you want, the collection of images will grow quickly but that’s fine.

Once you have a good number of print-outs or cuttings you can take time to leaf through and discard any that do not score ‘ten out of ten’. Then select individual details and, suddenly, your ideas will become firmer.

## 3. Ask for samples to approve

Choosing the right woods, veneers, paint finishes, fittings and so on can be quite daunting – there are a lot to look at.

Particularly when it comes to the material your cabinet doors and work-surfaces will be made of, you need to see a sample ‘in situ’ to check the colours, textures and so on, in the actual location and lighting your kitchen will be installed in.

Make sure by asking for samples, taking them home and making a final selection from there.

## 4. Ask if you can see your kitchen in production, is it genuinely BESPOKE!

There are so many kitchen companies claiming their work is bespoke but, in actuality, they buy in carcases or doors, or worktops from suppliers.

By using top quality manufacturers, this will give the appearance of a bespoke kitchen but in reality, it is about construction rather than creation.

If you ask to visit the place your kitchen is being made in and are invited to come along to see the craftsmen working on raw materials to hand-make your cabinets, you will see for yourself what ‘bespoke’ really means.

## 5. Check the options for available gadgets and internal storage solutions

It isn’t just the look of a kitchen that’s important. It’s the equipment and storage too.

There are plenty of manufacturers and websites to look at but, by speaking to us, we can give you our professional advice on making the most of your unique kitchen design by suggesting options and our knowledge of what works – and what doesn’t!

## 6. Take time to organise the lighting within your new kitchen

A lovely new kitchen deserves to be well lit, not just because it makes every detail stand out but because you will need lighting that enables you to prepare food, cook it and, possibly, to eat there.

It would be a shame if your kitchen – and your pleasure when using it – were spoilt because the overhead, under-cupboard, floor level and feature lighting isn’t considered as part of the overall design.

## 7. Check how any last minute changes may affect the final cost!

Finishing touches can be fatal for a budget, however generous, unless planned in from the start. However, there is often a ‘must have’ that people want to incorporate after the original design has been agreed.

Sometimes this is an ‘easy fix’ but not always. For example, changing a sink could completely alter the way the work-top surround and under-cabinet has to be made.

Everything is possible but always check what last minute, ‘good ideas’ will cost before giving a new instruction.
