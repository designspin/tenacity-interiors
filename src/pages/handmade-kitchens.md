  or socialise in, Tenacity Interiors will design the perfect ‘heart of the
  home’ for you, your family and your friends to enjoy.
title: So what makes a Tenacity Interiors’ kitchen so uniquely specific to you?
---
Firstly, one of Tenacity Interiors owners - Trevor Pragg or Karl Andrews - will personally visit and survey your property, so they have first-hand knowledge of how to maximise the use of space. During your initial meeting they will talk to you about what your ideal kitchen should be like, what equipment you want in it and the styles and materials you prefer.

You can select the finishing touches, too, such as whether door knobs will be visible or not, and the appliances that have to be housed. If you already know what you want, precisely, Tenacity Interiors will work to your own design ideas.

Gradually, a picture is built up and in a matter of days, you will receive drawings giving a detailed view of what the finished result will look like. And, cost-controlling alternatives can always be found to meet available budgets, thanks to the team’s comprehensive knowledge.

With everything decided, all you have to do is wait for the call that says “your kitchen is ready for you.” In fact, you are always welcome to visit the workshops in Great Massingham to see for yourself how things are going.

One aspect of having a Tenacity Interiors kitchen that constantly delights clients and professional interior designers alike, is the availability of a huge range of woods, work surface stone and granite options, veneers, high gloss and painted finishes – as well as the latest treatments and finishes for style-specific detailing such as Shaker or lime washed, for example.

The only limit is your imagination – but if you aren’t exactly sure, the Tenacity Interiors team will guide you through the planning phase so your kitchen will be more than you ever dreamed it could be. **To begin, all you need to do is call Karl or Trevor on 01485 521888.**
