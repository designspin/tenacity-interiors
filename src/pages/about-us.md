Both cabinetmakers were trained ‘the traditional way’ and their combined knowledge of design and construction of the most demanding projects has led to a strong reputation for Tenacity Interiors as the ‘go to’ company when quality, style and customer service is needed – as well as confidence that fitted or free-standing [furniture](/bespoke-furniture) projects will always be outstanding.

Both Karl Andrews and Trevor Pragg had many years’ experience as cabinet makers and joinery experts, and Karl’s CAD abilities continue to add to the planning, design, production and installation process.

The key to Tenacity Interiors’ success is dedication to creating the highest possible quality [furniture](/bespoke-furniture) whether it is free standing or for fitted installation, using the best available materials but also interpreting ideal alternatives so that developing interior design ideas and managing project budgets is always in careful balance.

Tenacity Interiors has an impressive reputation which reflects the comprehensive cabinet making ingenuity and joinery skills that are such a rare commodity today. The range of clients Karl Andrews and Trevor Pragg work with is as diverse as the many materials they use for interior design projects, and project locations are equally varied. Based in Great Massingham in Norfolk UK, the company has been called upon to create furniture for apartments in Mayfair and Whitehall, and New York, as well as in properties of all types and sizes across East Anglia and the South of England.

Whether a major refurbishment in the heart of London or a special project in the heart of East Anglia, the same quality of service, attention to detail and dedication to outstanding quality remains the same.
