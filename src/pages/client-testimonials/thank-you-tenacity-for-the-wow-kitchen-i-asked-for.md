  ...Karl, designed the kitchen from my very sketchy description and several
  drawings were sent to me to look at and to approve the design I wished to be
  fitted... The specification I gave to Karl at Tenacity to work with was, "I
  want a 'wow' kitchen". He selected all of the appliances and designed a stand
  alone dresser in oak to compliment the rest of the units. He also suggested
  and selected the type of work tops that would be suitable. All I had to do was
  choose the colour. It was a wonderful service. I felt thoroughly spoilt for
  choice...
