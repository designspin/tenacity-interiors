  The Tenacity team came up with great ideas from the outset. Right down to
  respraying canisters and a bread box to match the cabinet woodwork and feature
  colours used in the adjacent kitchen. Every unit was built at the Great
  Massingham workshops and when it was installed, the fit was perfect. The
  quality of the units for the refurbished Boot Room exceeded my high
  expectations. Everything I wanted to store could be neatly tucked away, the
  sink area was perfect and the whole room, with its striking use of a
  contrasting colour – Aubergine in this case – created a functional room that
  looked absolutely great.

  So much so that we asked Karl and Trevor if the team could refurbish a solid
  oak circular table, as well as building a special Boot Box for me. I was
  genuinely impressed with what they can do and extremely satisfied with the end
  result, which gets compliments from everyone who sees it.
